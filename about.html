    <p>"Only when we are in the presence of beauty, can we fully grasp our humanity. What we desire for our lives is that at the end of the day, beauty will get to have the last words. So go out there. Be musical. Be beautiful."</p>

<p2>I first heard these words from conductor Thomas Wilkins at an audience meet-and-greet after a concert feat. five-time Grammy winner Victor Wooten at the Boston Symphony. To say that I was touched to the core by Wilkins' words is a sheer understatement. Sharing beauty with the world is such a pivotal part of my identity and is the raison d'Ãªtre of my lifelong artistic pursuits - as a classical musician and, now, a visual artist. My wildest dream is that through Lisa's Lens, you will be inspired by new angles or fresh perspectives, and that you will experience the timeless beauty that defines our common humanity.</p2>
